## Technical Implementation Details

### Core JavaScript (main.js)
**Modules**:
- **CameraManager**: Handle camera feed simulation and grid layouts
- **AIDetectionEngine**: Simulate person detection and name tagging
- **AlertSystem**: Manage notifications and alert rules
- **AnalyticsEngine**: Generate real-time statistics and reports
- **UserManager**: Handle authentication and user sessions
- **PaymentProcessor**: Simulate payment transactions and billing
- **SystemMonitor**: Track system performance and health
- **DataStorage**: Local storage management for settings and data
- **WebSocketSimulator**: Real-time data streaming simulation
- **ThemeManager**: Handle dark/light mode and visual preferences

### Data Models
**Camera Feed**:
```javascript
{
  id: string,
  name: string,
  url: string,
  status: 'online'|'offline'|'recording',
  position: {x: number, y: number},
  detection: {
    enabled: boolean,
    sensitivity: number,
    alerts: string[]
  }
}
```

**Detected Person**:
```javascript
{
  id: string,
  name: string,
  confidence: number,
  boundingBox: {x: number, y: number, width: number, height: number},
  activity: 'working'|'break'|'away'|'alert',
  timestamp: Date,
  cameraId: string
}
```

**Alert Rule**:
```javascript
{
  id: string,
  name: string,
  conditions: Array<{
    type: 'person_count'|'activity'|'time',
    operator: '>'|'<'|'==',
    value: number|string
  }>,
  actions: Array<{
    type: 'notification'|'email'|'recording',
    target: string
  }>,
  enabled: boolean
}
```

### Animation & Effects
**Libraries Used**:
